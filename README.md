Alfred workflow for seamlessly processing audio files through Auphonic's API. [Auphonic](https://auphonic.com?source=robper) is a professional audio post-production service that provides automated audio processing and optimization, including leveling, noise reduction, and encoding.

**This workflow streamlines the uploading/downloading of audio files for them to be processed using up to four of your Auphonic presets.**

---
## FEATURES

- Process single or multiple audio files
- Real-time notifications of processing status
- Automatic download of processed files to Downloads folder
- Error handling with automatic redirect to Auphonic production page

---
## HOW TO

1. Select one or more files in Finder and open Alfred's actions window
2. Search for "Process with Auphonic" to process your files

The workflow keeps you updated in two ways:
- System notifications showing processing status
- Status updates in Alfred's search bar using your custom keyword

**Using Different Presets:**
- No modifier: Uses default preset
- Command (⌘): Uses preset 1
- Option (⌥): Uses preset 2
- Control (⌃): Uses preset 3

**Quick Tip:** If the Alfred search bar shows that no files are being processed, press CMD to open the last saved Auphonic URL. This helps when there's an error or server issue. You can always access your productions directly on Auphonic's website as well.
